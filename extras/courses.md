# Computer Science - Great Courses

Hello, my curious programmer friend! This page is pretty straightforward. For each category, a handful of courses that were not included in the main roadmap is listed. But do not worry, all the courses here are of very high quality, just like the ones you have been dealing with up to now. Having that said, have fun :)
