# Introduction

Let's begin by understanding how it will work. This guide is divided into different sections (such as Fundamentals, Core...) and subsections (such as CS tools and Core Programming within Core). For each proposed topic, learning materials, online courses, and sometimes textbooks, are provided along with links that directly take you to this external resource. Quick and easy!

This entire roadmap is guided by principles of high quality, accessibility, and real-world relevance. You will not waste your time with poorly produced materials nor get frustrated with courses or books that do not translate into useful and interesting knowledge. Moreover, there are courses or books that don't fit into this roadmap directly but are nevertheless worth your time, and they are found here:
- [extras/courses](extras/courses.md)
- [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).
- [extras/practice](extras/practice.md)

Having that said, here's the essential information you need to know to make the most out of this guide:

- `How is it organized`? The roadmap has the structure shown below.
  - *Fundamentals*: will present the basics of programming and computer science (CS), where you will start your learning journey, review concepts, and decide whether you want to continue in this area. 
  - *Core*: contains the central content of programming and computer science, which will be useful for all more specialized areas within the tech market.
  - *Advanced*: has alternative paths which will be chosen according to your interests and goals.
  - *Be Your Boss*: we are the Entropic Group, and of course, we could not leave entrepreneurship out of this material. This optional section addresses tech startups and service offerings as a programmer.
  - *The Entropic Programmer*: here you will build projects and start (or continue) building your portfolio. It's your path to become a true Entropic Programmer ðŸ˜Ž.

- `A note about (avoidable) costs`
  - Nearly all course material is freely available, and the material you need is freely accessible. However, some courses/platforms may charge money for assignments and tests (for access or grading). While Coursera and edX fall into this category for parts of their course catalog, both offer financial aid and options for free audit of courses (what, practice, will give you access to its content). Having that said, the contents are still freely accessible, and you can decide whether you want to pay some money for extra resources (like graded tests or certificates).
  - We mentioned that you can freely audit Coursera's courses and get access to its content for free, even though not extra materials such as graded assignments. For many of their courses, however, there is a workaround:
    - First, [audit the Coursera course](https://www.classcentral.com/report/coursera-signup-for-free/). Now you have access to content.
    - One thing that gives access to the extra paid portions of those courses (such as graded assignments and tests) is to search for the name of the course/specialization + "GitHub" in your search engine. That is because some kind people who take those courses register their progress (along with lecture material, *assignments*, and *tests*) in GitHub repositories, for reference purposes. That way, you can clone those repositories and refer to them anytime you face a paid portion of the course.


- `What is the best way to learn here`? It is your education, and you are empowered to mold it in whichever way you prefer. Nevertheless, some useful notes:
  - It is recommended that you take all courses in the Core section; they give you the foundation for future learning! However, feel free to skip courses if you feel like you already know the topic from previous experiences. Also, while taking the courses in order will maybe provide the smoothest experience, you can take several courses in parallel (for instance, math and programming courses).
  - Courses in the Advanced part are all alternative paths you can take. Choose at least one and complete it. Needless to say, feel free to take as many specializations and advanced paths as you want.

# Networking

If you are still reading this, chances are you're interested in our work... and there is good news: there is much, much more. First of all let me explain what this "Entropic Group" stuff is all about. We are a group that brings together entrepreneurs, programmers, and professionals of all kinds who seek self-development and networking. Through our Discord server (which is totally free to access!), members can:
- Network with other professionals

# Roadmap
You now arrived at the roadmap itself. Time to learn!

## Fundamentals

### Introduction to Programming

Are you totally new to programming? This is a wonderful way to begin! This course by Harvard will teach you the essential concepts of programming using Python. You can also choose to take another language as your first one, just make sure that your learning material covers all the essential concepts in programming (such as data types, variables, control structures, iteration, notions of algorithms, modules, and much more...).

**Topics covered**:
`basic concepts of programming`

Courses | Prerequisites 
:-- | :--: 
[Introduction to programming](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/) | none 

### Introduction to Computer Science

This course will take you a step further and combine what you learning in your intro to programming with other important concepts from the subject of Computer Science, such as notions of algorithms, the basics of data structures, memory, and more. This knowledge is essential to any programmer who wants to build sophisticated systems. Moreover, if might be good to note that the courses are full of programming, so there is more coding waiting for you!

**Topics covered**:
`basics concepts of CS`
`basic data structures and algorithms`
`explore more programming`

Courses | Prerequisites

[Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python, by MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/) or [Introduction to Computer Science, by Harvard (introduces different programming languages)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) | [high school algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home) 

## Core

This section contains the core knowledge you will need as a programmer to successfully develop applications and take more specialized paths in the future.

### Core programming
At this point, you can already call yourself a programmer, but let's take this a step further and get you closer to being a _entropic programmer_. In this section, you'll deepen your knowledge about programming, discover new paradigms used in modern programming, and learn how to incorporate good design decisions into your code. These concepts often mark a division between amateurs and good professionals; if you are in the second category, you're a step closer to making good money within this field. 

**Topics covered**:
`functional programming`
`design for testing`
`program requirements`
`common design patterns`
`unit testing`
`object-oriented design`
`static typing`
`dynamic typing`
`ML-family languages (via Standard ML)`
`Lisp-family languages (via Racket)`
`Ruby`
`and more`

### Core math
I know what you're thinking... "Math?! I'm here for coding!". Believe me, maths intersects with programming and computer science in wonderful and useful ways, and a good coder knows ho how to use math along with code to create solutions, services, and programs that deal with the most complicated types of computations. Having that said, let's get some idea about what awaits you:
- `Mathematics for Computer Science`: this course will teach you different mathematical topics (mostly from a branch of Mathematics known as Discrete Math) that show up in many areas of CS. It will also be handy when you start studying Data Structures and Algorithms.
- `Calculus`: Machine Learning and AI, Computer Graphics/Image Processing, and Probability/Statistics are some of the subjects that use Calculus in their composition. I think that tells a lot about the importance of Calculus, right?

**Topics covered**:
`discrete mathematics`
`mathematical proofs`
`basic statistics`
`O-notation`
`discrete probability`
`derivatives and integrals`

Courses | Prerequisites

### CS Tools
Every creator needs to master its tools, and so do programmers. Traditional classes often overlook some of the most important tools in programming and leave many students with a gap in their knowledge that will sooner or later show up negatively in their careers. Let's fix that now. The course "The Missing Semester of Your CS Education" will equip you with a powerful set of programming tools that are used industry-wide.

**Topics covered**:
`terminals and shell scripting`
`vim`
`command line environments`
`version control`
`and more`

## The Entropic Programmer

An integral part of learning how to code is doing. Write and read code, get feedback, and repeat. It is that simple. Now, it is time to engage in projects and build working applications, like a true Entropic Programmer ðŸ˜Ž. There are many ways to get good ideas for projects, such as:

- Take a problem in your daily life that bothers you. Can you create a program that solves it?
- Can you take some open-source projects and enhance or customize them?
- Do you have a startup idea? Try creating your first MVPs.
- Search for [lists of project ideas](https://github.com/The-Cool-Coders/Project-Ideas-And-Resources) 

If you want a more guided approach, those project-focused courses might be a good choice:
